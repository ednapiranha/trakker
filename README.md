# Trakker

Convert tracklists to a list of objects.

## Tracklist Assumptions

Your tracklist is generally in the format of:

    01. [00:00:10] Some track title and/or Producer

Or

    01.) Some track title and/or Producer

Or

    Some track title and/or Producer

Anyway, you get the idea!

Trakker only accepts a string input, not a file. Figure that out separately - or check the test for an example.

## Installation
